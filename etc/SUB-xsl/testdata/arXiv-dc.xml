<dc:description>  This is a short survey of author's results on Voevodsky's motives and weight
structures. Weight structures are natural counterparts of t-structures (for
triangulated categories) introduced by the author. They allow to construct
weight complexes, weight filtrations, and weight spectral sequences for various
cohomology theories. Partial cases of the latter are: 'classical' weight
spectral sequences (for singular and etale cohomology), coniveau spectral
sequences, and Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences. All of those are mentioned
in the current paper. The details, proofs, and several more results could be
found in other papers of the author (cited here). We also describe a certain
triangulated category of comotives that contains reasonable (co)motives for all
function fields (and also of other projective limits of smooth varieties).

<dc:description>Comment: The exposition is improved; some of the results of new preprints
  ([Bon10b], [Heb10], and [Bon10p]) on motives over various base schemes and
  mixed sheaves are now mentioned</dc:description>
