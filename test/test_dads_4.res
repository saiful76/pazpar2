<md-title>Evolution of Water Management in Mexico</md-title>
<md-author>Arreguin Cortes, Felipe I</md-author>
<md-description>The recognition of the need for an integrated and humane management of water resources has been gradually developed as a result of several major international conferences and forums. These, together with the World Water Vision, have reinforced the need for a comprehensive assessment of global freshwater resources as a basis for implementing a more integrated management of water. The recommendations suggested in the meetings and international forums have undoubtedly helped the development of water resources management in Mexico. In general, however, to implement them effectively and efficiently, it is necessary to develop financial mechanisms available to the payment capacity of each country and establish reasonable deadlines for meeting the goals. This paper analyses the impact of the recommendations arising from international meetings on water management in Mexico as well as their compliance in terms of water and wastewater management</md-description><location id="dbc-test.dadsthirdnode.cvt.dk/sru-proxy" name="SOLR Test">

<md-title>Emergency Drinking Water Treatment during Source Water Pollution Accidents in China: Origin Analysis, Framework and Technologies</md-title>
<md-author>XIAO-HAN ZHANG</md-author>
<md-description>China has suffered frequent source water contamination accidents in the past decade, which has resulted in severe consequences to the water supply of millions of residents. The origins of typical cases of contamination are discussed in this paper as well as the emergency response to these accidents. In general, excessive pursuit of rapid industrialization and the unreasonable location of factories are responsible for the increasing frequency of accidental pollution events. Moreover, insufficient attention to environmental protection and rudimentary emergency response capability has exacerbated the consequences of such accidents. These environmental accidents triggered or accelerated the promulgation of stricter environmental protection policy and the shift from economic development mode to a more sustainable direction, which should be regarded as the turning point of environmental protection in China. To guarantee water security, China is trying to establish a rapid and effective emergency response framework, build up the capability of early accident detection, and develop efficient technologies to remove contaminants from water</md-description><location id="dbc-test.dadsthirdnode.cvt.dk/sru-proxy" name="SOLR Test">

<md-title>Water Management in the Ebro River Basin: An Approach to the 2010-15 Hydrological Plan</md-title>
<md-author>Omedas-Margeli, Manuel</md-author>
<md-description>Water management professionals generally recognize that the management of water in rivers and aquifers is more efficient and sustainable at the river basin level than at the political and administrative levels of regional administrations. The development and consolidation of the river basin authorities has not been without difficulties. Experience has shown that the Spanish river basin confederations, the French water agencies and the US valley authorities have been successful. There have also, however, been failures, many attributable to the difficulties of separating the political power of regions and nation-states. In the Ebro River Basin, integrated water resources management was applied even when it crossed the administrative borders of the Autonomous Communities; otherwise, the water produced by the Ebro would be one-quarter of its current volume. Thanks to the integrated management, the Ebro economic region is supplied by major reservoirs, especially the Ebro reservoir. Its major irrigation systems, the Aragon and Catalonia Canal, Bardenas, the Ebro Delta and others, are projects that were conceived under the principle of integrated water management</md-description><location id="dbc-test.dadsthirdnode.cvt.dk/sru-proxy" name="SOLR Test">

<md-title>Two worlds of assessment of environmental health issues: the case of contaminated water wells in Ramat ha-Sharon</md-title>
<md-author>Geiger, Brenda</md-author>
<md-description>This research examines two modes of assessment of environmental health risks and the transformation of these risks into public health issues while relying on the specific case of well-water toxicity and mega dose of electromagnetic radiation found in one prosperous town in the center of Israel - Ramat ha-Sharon. Based on official and scientific documentation and interviews conducted at three time periods with randomly selected town residents from contaminated neighborhoods (N = 169), this study shows the discrepancy between the &apos;objective&apos; experts&apos; standards for assessing environmental health risks and the public&apos;s subjective perception and evaluation of the impact of these risks on their health and well-being. Even though, by experts&apos; standards, the well-water toxicity remained constant over the three interview sessions, Ramat ha-Sharon town residents&apos; subjective levels of concern and perception of risk fluctuated as a function of news media and municipality announcements and residents&apos; perceived ability to minimize the risk. This study also shows the complex and multidisciplinary nature of environmental health risk assessments and the need to relocate them into the broader socioeconomic and political context in which they are embedded</md-description><location id="dbc-test.dadsthirdnode.cvt.dk/sru-proxy" name="SOLR Test">

<md-description>The severe droughts of the 1990s made clear that the Strategic Plan of Zaragoza and the Action Plan of Local Agenda 21 in terms of water management were not appropriate to satisfy the development needs of its economy and the future demands of a growing population. In response, the city redefined its water management model, from one of continuous exploitation of resources to the search for solutions to reduce consumption. The city&apos;s efforts included a comprehensive programme of stakeholder involvement, rehabilitation of drinking water treatment and distribution infrastructure, improvement of water quality, and reform of the billing system. After 12 years, the city has managed to deduce its total consumption by nearly 30% and improve the quality of its water very significantly</md-description><location id="dbc-test.dadsthirdnode.cvt.dk/sru-proxy" name="SOLR Test">

<md-title>Water-A Reflection of Land Use: Understanding of Water Pathways and Quality Genesis</md-title>
<md-author>Falkenmark, Malin</md-author>
<md-description>The paper aims at a scientifically based synthesis of water quality genesis and pollution problems arising from human interventions in the landscape, physical as well as chemical. First, water quality genesis is explained in terms of sources, water pathways and some time scales involved. It goes on to look closer at chemical reactions along water pathways down a landscape catena, using the simple perception of a stream tube. The river quality outcome is explained in terms of a mix of water fractions with different hydrochemical signatures. Water quality is finally looked at in a 4000-year perspective, explaining some regional similarities and differences in the past. In looking towards the future, a potential further intensification and expansion in scale is seen as probable in response to driving forces at work, poor mitigation capabilities and the long response times involved</md-description><location id="dbc-test.dadsthirdnode.cvt.dk/sru-proxy" name="SOLR Test">

<md-title>Water use efficiency in the hotel sector of Barbados</md-title>
<md-author>Cashman, Adrian</md-author>
<md-description>Barbados is water stressed, with water production close to its renewable freshwater resources. The hotel sector uses far more water than the general population (756 vs. 240 L/cap-d); water savings there would improve the overall water balance. No comprehensive analysis exists for water use by the Barbados hotel industry; this study addresses the gap. Data were collected from the Barbados Water Authority and from onsite surveys; consumption patterns were compared with international studies which had established environmentally acceptable benchmarks. The water use efficiency of Barbadian hotels was also studied as a function of &apos;influential variables&apos;: unit water consumption was somewhat correlated with the number of rooms, average room rate, property size and number of employees. The lack of success in reducing hotels&apos; water consumption is tied to the fact that water bills represent less than 5% of their annual expenses. A model for unit water consumption was derived using two influential variables: the annual number of guest nights and the number of employees. Ways of fostering sound water practices include promotion among guests of the need to save water, schemes to promote the financial benefits of water conservation by relating unit water pricing to total consumption and awareness-raising among hotel managers</md-description><location id="dbc-test.dadsthirdnode.cvt.dk/sru-proxy" name="SOLR Test">

<md-title>Water Quality Management in Egypt</md-title>
<md-author>Abdel-Dayem, Safwat</md-author>
<md-description>One of the greatest water-related challenges facing Egypt is the pollution of its surface and ground water resources from agricultural, domestic and industrial sources. The cost of environmental degradation due to water quality deterioration is relatively high with serious health and quality-of-life consequences. The closed water system of the country makes it more vulnerable to quality deterioration in a northward direction. The water quality of Lake Naser upstream of the High Aswan Dam and the main stem of the River Nile from Aswan to Cairo is good and traces of pollutants, if any, are far below the levels set in the quality standards set by Law 48. However, water quality in the irrigation and drainage canals deteriorates downstream and reaches alarming levels in the Delta. Monitoring water quality of the Nile system (Lake Naser, the main Nile and its branches, irrigation canals, drains and groundwater aquifers) started as early as the 1980s. The complexity of water quality management required the development of other mechanisms including policies, institutional and governance arrangements, infrastructure for monitoring and analytic laboratories, awareness and skilled human resources. This paper describes the different aspects of water quality management in Egypt and the current state as it stands by the end of the first decade of the 21st century. It also presents the methodology used in turning several monitoring programmes managed by different institutions into one national integrated system. It argues that water quality management is multifaceted and while progress along one aspect could be significant, other aspects could be lacking due to multiple reasons, the high cost involved in pollution reduction at the source is not the least</md-description><location id="dbc-test.dadsthirdnode.cvt.dk/sru-proxy" name="SOLR Test">

<md-title>What&apos;s Next after 40 Years of Drinking Water Regulations?</md-title>
<md-author>ROBERSON, J. ALAN</md-author>
<md-description>The quality of drinking water in the United States has continued to improve over the past 40 years.
