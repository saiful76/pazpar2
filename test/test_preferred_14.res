<md-author>McInerney, Valentina; University of Western Sydney; Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences</md-author>
<md-description>This thesis represents the results of studies designed to investigate computer anxiety among adult learners. The existence, nature and degree of computer anxiety were investigated with a sample of teacher trainees undertaking an introductory computer training course, and the impact of this course on the anxiety and cognitions of the students were studied. Another study focussed on the evaluation of the measure of computer anxiety used in this study with a view to the design of a new computer anxiety treatment. Results showed that computer anxiety is not necessarily dissipated by completing a computer course, and is correlated with gender, computer ownership and previous computer experience. A number of faculties with different student populations were studied, and computer anxiety was high within each. Interviews with computing course coordinators indicated a range of approaches to instructional design, beliefs about the extent and causes of computer anxiety, and ways of alleviating it.

<md-title>Examination of Factors that Influence Computer Technology Use for Classroom Instruction by Teachers in Ohio Public High Schools</md-title>
<md-date>2009</md-date>
<md-author>Latio, Gambu Wani</md-author>
<md-description>The focus of this research was to determine the extent to which teachers in Ohio public high schools use computers in classroom instruction, and investigation of barriers to teachers’ integration of computers into classroom instruction and learning. The analyses were based on a sample of 256 teachers randomly selected from 18 randomly selected high schools across the state. About 77% of the participants considered themselves well prepared, and 83% were proficient in computer technology integration. Although the majority of the participants had attained the necessary computer skills, teachers’ use of computers for classroom learning was low and sporadic at best, averaging 1.8 times a week, a level equivalence of novice computer using teacher. Both computer proficiency and availability of computers in Ohio public high school classrooms greatly affected teachers’ extent of computer technology use in classroom learning.

<md-title>The Computer-Aided Analytic Process Model. Operations Handbook for the APM (Analytic Process Model) Demonstration Package. Appendix</md-title>
<md-date>1986</md-date>
<md-author>Shapiro,Ronald G</md-author>
<md-description>The Computer-Aided APM Demonstration Package provides the analyst with the opportunity to perform a thorough analysis of a system while the computer keeps track of the analysis and insures that the analyst examines the parts of the data base which are of interest. This is, however, a demonstration package which can only process small data bases. Because the package is implemented on an Apple II Plus, processing is relatively slow. An explanation of the APM, listings of the data sets derived using the APM and recommendations for further development of the APM appear in the companion volume--The Analytic Process Model for System Design and Measurement: A Computer-Aided Tool for Analyzing Training Systems and Other Human-Machine Systems. A separate companion volume--The Computer-Aided Analytic Process Model: Operations Handbook for the APM Demonstration Package is also available under separate cover. This volume, which is an Appendix to the Operations Handbook, contains the actual PASCAL computer code listings.

<md-title>Computer Programs for the Analysis of Spacecraft Magnetism</md-title>
<md-date>1973</md-date>
<md-author>Lackey,Milton H</md-author>
<md-description>The report describes five computer programs that are being used at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory for analyzing satellite magnetism. The programs contain numerical analysis algorithms for the spherical harmonic analysis of the magnetic field emanating from a satellite. The analysis is directed at determining the components of the magnetism which correspond to the dipole moment, quadrupole moment, etc. The first three programs were devised to analyze data from magnetic field measurements around the satellite. The fourth program was devised to generate simulated measurement data for a specified system of multipole magnets. The last program is a combination of the data generation and the data analysis programs. Sample problems are included in the discussion to illustrate the techniques of using the programs with a CDC 6400 Computer including the INTERCOM time-sharing system. A brief description is also included of data acquisition techniques and of principal subprograms. (Author)</md-description><location id="ocs-oaister.indexdata.com/solr/select" name="Oaister (SOLR)">
