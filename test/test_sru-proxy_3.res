<md-title>Water, Water Everywhere</md-title>
<md-description>The article focuses on The Global Chemistry Experiment for the International Year of Chemistry (IYC) 2011, which is a set of experiments based on the attraction of water for young people and its chemical properties. Water: A Chemical Solution involves a set of four simple experiments aimed at encouraging students around the world to learn how chemistry contributes to water. Information on the experiments can be obtained from the IYC 2011 Web site</md-description>

<md-title>Water Markets, Licenses, and Conservation: Some Implications</md-title>
<md-author>Janmaat, Johannus</md-author>
<md-description>While water markets have long been advocated as a tool for both enhancing water use efficiency and enabling conservation purchases, their interaction with water rights and licenses has been little studied. It is shown that when water rights are not tradable, using spot markets to secure conservation needs may harm some water users. Ironically, while a spot market enhances the efficiency of water use, it may also increase the cost of conservation purchases. Further, a self-funding conservation program, where volumetric license carrying charges pay for conservation purchases, creates a transfer from junior water users to senior water users</md-description>

<md-title>Institutional Path Dependence in Climate Adaptation: Coman&apos;s &apos;&apos;Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation&apos;&apos;</md-title>
<md-author>Libecap, Gary D</md-author>
<md-description>Katharine Coman&apos;s &apos;&apos;Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation,&apos;&apos; published in March 1911 in the first issue of the American Economic Review, addressed issues of water supply, rights, and organization. These same issues have relevance today, in the face of growing concern about the availability of fresh water worldwide. The central point of this article is that appropriative water rights and irrigation districts that emerged in the American West in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in response to aridity to facilitate agricultural water delivery, use, and trade raise the transaction costs today of water markets. These markets are vital for smooth reallocation of water to higher-valued uses elsewhere in the economy and for flexible response to greater hydrological uncertainty. This institutional path dependence illustrates how past arrangements to meet conditions of the time constrain contemporary economic opportunities. They cannot be easily significantly modified or replaced ex post. (JEL N51, Q15, Q25, Q54)</md-description>
